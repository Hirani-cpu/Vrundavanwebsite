## ⚙️ Firebase Setup Steps

### Step 1: Get Your Firebase Credentials

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `vrundavan-resort-website`
3. Click the **gear icon** ⚙️ next to "Project Overview"
4. Select **"Project settings"**
5. Scroll down to **"Your apps"** section
6. If you haven't added a web app:
   - Click **"Add app"** button
   - Select **Web (</> icon)**
   - Register your app with a nickname (e.g., "Vrundavan Website")
   - Copy the `firebaseConfig` object

### Step 2: Update firebase-config.js

Open `firebase-config.js` and replace the placeholder values:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",                    // ← Replace with your actual API key
  authDomain: "vrundavan-resort-website.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "vrundavan-resort-website",
  storageBucket: "vrundavan-resort-website.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",       // ← Replace with your actual sender ID
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"                       // ← Replace with your actual app ID
};
```

### Step 3: Enable Firestore Database

1. In Firebase Console, go to **"Firestore Database"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Create database"**
3. Choose **"Start in production mode"** or **"Start in test mode"** (recommended for development)
4. Select your preferred Cloud Firestore location
5. Click **"Enable"**

### Step 4: Create Firestore Collections

The collections will be created automatically when the first booking is submitted. However, you can create them manually:

1. In Firestore Database, click **"Start collection"**
2. Create collection: `roomBookings`
3. Add a test document with these fields:
   ```
   fullName: "Test User"
   phone: "1234567890"
   email: "test@example.com"
   checkIn: "2025-01-15"
   checkOut: "2025-01-17"
   adults: 2
   children: 0
   roomType: "Deluxe AC Room"
   specialRequests: ""
   bookingStatus: "pending"
   createdAt: (timestamp)
   ```

4. Repeat for `eventBookings` collection:
   ```
   fullName: "Test User"
   phone: "1234567890"
   email: "test@example.com"
   eventType: "Wedding"
   guests: 100
   preferredArea: "Garden/Lawn"
   eventDate: "2025-02-01"
   timeSlot: "Evening (6 PM - 11 PM)"
   message: ""
   bookingStatus: "pending"
   createdAt: (timestamp)
   ```

### Step 5: Set Firestore Security Rules

1. Go to **"Firestore Database" → "Rules"** tab
2. Update the rules to allow read/write access:

**For Development (test mode):**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow anyone to submit bookings
    match /roomBookings/{document=**} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }

    match /eventBookings/{document=**} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**For Production (recommended):**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only allow authenticated admins to read/write
    match /roomBookings/{document=**} {
      allow create: if true;  // Anyone can submit bookings
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }

    match /eventBookings/{document=**} {
      allow create: if true;  // Anyone can submit bookings
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.token.admin == true;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **"Publish"**

### Step 6: Enable Firebase Authentication

1. Go to **"Authentication"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"Get started"**
3. Go to **"Sign-in method"** tab
4. Click on **"Email/Password"**
5. **Enable** Email/Password sign-in
6. Click **"Save"**

### Step 7: Create Admin User

1. In **"Authentication" → "Users"** tab
2. Click **"Add user"**
3. Enter admin credentials:
   - **Email**: admin@vrundavanresort.com (or your preferred email)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Bookings not showing in dashboard?

**IMPORTANT: Use the Diagnostic Tool First!**

1. Open `firestore-test.html` in your browser
2. Click "Run All Tests" button
3. This will show you exactly what's wrong:
   - If Firebase is connected
   - If Firestore security rules are blocking queries
   - If collections exist and have data
   - Detailed error messages

**Common Issues:**

#### Issue 1: Permission Denied Errors
If you see "permission-denied" errors in the diagnostic tool or browser console:

1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Update your rules to this (for testing):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /roomBookings/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;  // Allow all for testing
    }
    match /eventBookings/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;  // Allow all for testing
    }
  }
}
```
3. Click **"Publish"**
4. Wait 30 seconds and try again

#### Issue 2: Collections Don't Exist
If diagnostic tool shows "0 bookings found":
- The collections might not exist yet
- Click "Create Test Room Booking" in the diagnostic tool
- Then go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database
- You should see the `roomBookings` collection appear
- Now try viewing in dashboard

#### Issue 3: Firestore Index Required
If you see errors about "requires an index":
- The error message will have a link
- Click the link to automatically create the index
- Wait 1-2 minutes for index to build
- Try again

### Bookings not saving?
- Use the diagnostic tool `firestore-test.html` to test
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify Firebase config is correct in `firebase-config.js`
- Check Firestore security rules allow `create` operations
- Ensure Firebase SDK scripts are loaded before `firebase-config.js`

### Can't login to admin?
- Admin users must be registered through the website first
- Admin emails must be in the ADMIN_EMAILS list in `script.js`
- Default admin emails:
  - `admin@vrundavanresort.com`
  - `vishal@vrundavanresort.com`
- Make sure you register with one of these emails first
- Then login with the same credentials
- Admin panel will appear in Account → Settings

### Dashboard not showing bookings?
1. First, run `firestore-test.html` to diagnose the issue
2. Check if you're logged in with an admin email
3. Verify Firestore security rules allow `read` operations
4. Check browser console (F12) for Firestore errors
5. Try clicking the "Refresh" button
6. Make sure collections have data (check Firebase Console)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Email Notifications**: Set up Cloud Functions to send email notifications when bookings are received
2. **Custom Admin Claims**: Add admin role claims for better security
3. **Booking Status Updates**: Add ability to change booking status (pending/confirmed/cancelled) from dashboard
4. **Export Data**: Add CSV export functionality for bookings
5. **Search & Filter**: Add search and date filtering in dashboard
6. **Booking Details Modal**: Add ability to view full booking details in a modal

---

## 💡 Important Notes

- **Never commit `firebase-config.js` with real credentials to public repositories**
- Use environment variables for production
- Regularly backup your Firestore data
- Monitor Firebase usage in Firebase Console
- Update security rules for production environment
- Use strong passwords for admin accounts
